# Horizon Radar Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**User Request**: [Comprehensive Performance & AI Slop Optimization Analysis]
- **Priority 1**: Reduce lines of code in Header.tsx without reducing functionality
- **Priority 2**: Optimize search algorithm (keep batch processing, remove pre-processed lowercase text)
- **Priority 3**: Increase search debouncing from 150ms to 350ms
- **Priority 4**: Consolidate all inline SVG icons into Icons.tsx, replace usage, standardize naming
- **Priority 5**: Optimize image loading with next/image (without lazy loading)
- **Priority 6**: Make background of /premium page black

**Mode**: Started in PLANNER, then switched to EXECUTOR for specific optimization tasks.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Code Duplication Issues
- Massive duplication between ProductCard.tsx (107 lines) and ProtocolCard.tsx (14 lines)
- Inline SVG icons scattered across multiple components
- Similar button patterns repeated across components
- Unused components and files taking up space

### Performance Bottlenecks
- localStorageDB.ts: 979 lines with heavy mock data initialization
- Header.tsx: 584 lines with complex search logic
- Inline styles causing unnecessary re-renders
- Complex type assertions slowing development

### Type Safety Concerns
- Unsafe window type assertions in multiple components
- Complex type casting that could be simplified
- Some any types in utility functions

### Banner System Requirements
- All banners must maintain 3:1 horizontal ratio (1500x500)
- Update article hero sections to use proper banner dimensions
- Update ProductCard components to use proper banner dimensions
- Move GlowBanner.png from Downloads to public/images folder
- Update glow article to use the new banner

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Remove Unused Components (Quick Wins)
**Plan**: Delete unused files for immediate LOC reduction
- **Target**: Unused components and files taking up space
- **Approach**:
  1. Search for files with 0 imports in codebase
  2. Check for components not used in any page or component
  3. Verify files are truly unused (not dynamically imported)
  4. Delete confirmed unused files
  5. Remove any orphaned imports
- **Success Criteria**: Reduced LOC without breaking functionality
- **Files**: All component files, focus on those with no imports

### Phase 2: Profile Icon Popup Fix (UI Fix)
**Plan**: Fix profile icon popup functionality on golden card in /profile page
- **Target**: ProfilePicture component in golden card section
- **Approach**: 
  1. Check ProfilePicture component for onClick handler
  2. Verify ProfileUploadModal state management (isOpen, onClose)
  3. Test click event propagation and modal trigger
  4. Ensure modal renders above other content (z-index)
  5. Test modal close functionality (X button, backdrop click)
- **Success Criteria**: Clicking profile icon opens upload modal, modal closes properly
- **Files**: `src/components/ProfilePicture.tsx`, `src/components/ProfileUploadModal.tsx`, `src/app/profile/page.tsx`

### Phase 3: Merge Card Components (Backend Only - No UI Changes)
**Plan**: Unify ProductCard and ProtocolCard into single UnifiedCard component
- **Target**: Eliminate duplication between ProductCard.tsx (107 lines) and ProtocolCard.tsx (14 lines)
- **Approach**:
  1. Compare ProductCard and ProtocolCard props and structure
  2. Extend UnifiedCard to handle both card types via `variant` prop
  3. Move unique logic from each card to UnifiedCard
  4. Update all imports: ProductCard → UnifiedCard, ProtocolCard → UnifiedCard
  5. Delete ProductCard.tsx and ProtocolCard.tsx
  6. Test that all existing functionality works
- **Success Criteria**: All existing functionality preserved, no visual changes, reduced LOC
- **Files**: `src/components/UnifiedCard.tsx`, `src/components/ProductCard.tsx`, `src/components/ProtocolCard.tsx`

### Phase 4: Remove Inline Styles (Backend Only - No UI Changes)
**Plan**: Replace inline styles with CSS classes and utilities
- **Target**: Components with inline style objects
- **Approach**:
  1. Search for `style={{` patterns in all component files
  2. For each inline style, find equivalent Tailwind utility classes
  3. Replace `style={{color: 'red'}}` with `className="text-red-500"`
  4. For complex styles, add custom CSS classes to `tokens.css`
  5. Test that visual appearance remains identical
- **Success Criteria**: No inline styles remain, identical visual output
- **Files**: All component files, focus on those with style props

### Phase 5: Simplify Type Assertions (Backend Only - No UI Changes)
**Plan**: Clean up unsafe type casting and complex type assertions
- **Target**: Components with `as any`, `as HTMLElement`, complex type casting
- **Approach**:
  1. Search for `as` keyword in all TypeScript files
  2. Replace `as any` with proper interface or type definition
  3. Replace `as HTMLElement` with proper type guards
  4. Remove unnecessary type assertions where TypeScript can infer types
  5. Add null checks for DOM element access
- **Success Criteria**: No unsafe type assertions, proper TypeScript types
- **Files**: All TypeScript files, focus on components with DOM manipulation

### Phase 6: Database Schema Audit & Validation (Data Integrity)
**Plan**: Comprehensive review of database usage across all pages and components
- **Target**: Ensure all UI elements have corresponding database fields
- **Approach**:
  1. **Profile Page**: Check user form fields map to User type in localStorageDB
  2. **Article Pages**: Verify article fields, reading levels, watchlist in Article type
  3. **Admin Panel**: Check CRUD operations use proper database methods
  4. **Login System**: Verify user authentication uses localStorageDB
  5. **Watchlist System**: Ensure watchlist array in User type
  6. **Research Requests**: Check request form fields in localStorageDB
  7. **Fix any mismatches**: Add missing fields or remove orphaned data
- **Success Criteria**: Every UI element has proper database backing, no orphaned data
- **Files**: `src/data/localStorageDB.ts`, `src/types/index.ts`, all page components

### Phase 7: Consolidate Button Patterns (Backend Only - No UI Changes)
**Plan**: Unify button implementations across components
- **Target**: Similar button patterns repeated across components
- **Approach**:
  1. Identify 3-4 common button patterns (primary, secondary, glass, icon)
  2. Create Button component with variant prop in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`
  3. Replace custom button JSX with `<Button variant="primary">`
  4. Ensure all button props (onClick, disabled, etc.) work consistently
  5. Test that all buttons function identically
- **Success Criteria**: Consistent button behavior, reduced duplication, no visual changes
- **Files**: Create `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`, update all button usage

### Phase 8: Clean Up Constants (Data & Pattern Optimization)
**Plan**: Ensure consistent usage of UI constants and design tokens
- **Target**: `src/constants/ui.ts`, `src/styles/tokens.css`
- **Approach**:
  1. Search for hardcoded colors (hex codes, rgb values) in components
  2. Replace with constants from `ui.ts` or CSS custom properties
  3. Search for hardcoded spacing values (px, rem) in components
  4. Replace with Tailwind utilities or CSS custom properties
  5. Remove duplicate constants in `ui.ts`
  6. Ensure consistent naming (kebab-case for CSS, camelCase for JS)
- **Success Criteria**: All styling uses consistent constants, no hardcoded values
- **Files**: `src/constants/ui.ts`, `src/styles/tokens.css`, all component files

## /why Scroll Assistant Refactor

**Task**: Adjust existing right-side scroll assistant component for slimmer design and pill-shaped active indicators

**Changes Made**:
1. **Container Width Reduction**: Changed main container padding from `p-2` to `p-1.5` (~40% slimmer)
2. **Active Indicator Pill Shape**: 
   - Active state: `w-2 h-3` (taller pill shape)
   - Inactive state: `w-2 h-2` (small circles)
   - Active color: `bg-[rgb(var(--color-horizon-green))]` (using existing token)
3. **Arrow Button Proportional Sizing**:
   - Button padding: `p-3` → `p-2` (reduced proportionally)
   - SVG icon size: `w-6 h-6` → `w-5 h-5` (reduced proportionally)
4. **Section Indicator Spacing**: Adjusted margin from `my-2` to `my-1.5` for better balance

**Design Principles Applied**:
- Maintained glass/translucent styling using existing design tokens
- Preserved all current functionality and interactions
- Ensured active pill height pushes neighboring indicators dynamically
- No layout overlap - clean vertical alignment maintained

**Rollback Notes**: 
- Revert container padding from `p-1.5` to `p-2`
- Revert button padding from `p-2` to `p-3` 
- Revert SVG sizes from `w-5 h-5` to `w-6 h-6`

## /why Snap + Keyboard Behavior

**Task**: Implement smooth and predictable section-to-section navigation with snap scrolling and keyboard support

**Changes Made**:
1. **Threshold-Based Scroll Navigation**:
   - Small scroll (50-149px): advances 1 section
   - Medium scroll (150-299px): advances 2 sections
   - Large scroll (300px+): advances 3 sections
   - Below 50px: no section change (prevents accidental navigation)

2. **Enhanced Keyboard Support**:
   - **ArrowDown/PageDown**: Navigate to next section
   - **ArrowUp/PageUp**: Navigate to previous section
   - All keyboard navigation uses smooth scrolling with `block: 'center'` alignment
   - Consistent 800ms timeout for scroll state management

3. **Smooth Snap Scrolling**:
   - All navigation uses `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })`
   - Consistent timing: 800ms for scroll state reset (reduced from 1000ms)
   - Wheel timeout reduced from 300ms to 200ms for better responsiveness
   - Prevents double-triggering and ensures clean section transitions

4. **Scroll State Management**:
   - Accumulates scroll delta for threshold-based navigation
   - Resets threshold after each section change
   - Prevents navigation during active scrolling
   - Maintains current section highlighting in scroll assistant

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Scroll Thresholds**: 50px, 150px, 300px for progressive navigation
- **Timing**: 800ms scroll timeout, 200ms wheel timeout
- **Behavior**: Smooth scrolling with center alignment
- **State**: Prevents overlap and ensures clean transitions

**Rollback Notes**:
- Revert scroll thresholds to single 120px threshold
- Revert timing from 800ms to 1000ms
- Revert wheel timeout from 200ms to 300ms
- Revert threshold-based navigation to single-section advancement

   - **Removed**: Fixed `opacity-10` class from container div
   - **Preserved**: Original grid pattern and sizing (50px x 50px)

3. **Visual Effect**:
   - Grid lines start subtle at the top of the page
   - Gradually become more prominent as user scrolls down
   - Creates depth and visual hierarchy
   - Maintains existing grid pattern and animations

**Technical Details**:
- **CSS Properties**: `maskImage`, `WebkitMaskImage` for cross-browser support
- **Gradient Values**: 
  - 0%: `transparent` (0% opacity)
  - 10%: `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` (10% opacity)
  - 100%: `rgba(255,255,255,0.5)` (50% opacity)

- Restore default browser scrollbar behavior

## /why Logo Sizing Adjustment

**Task**: Fix squished logo and increase size by 65%

**Changes Made**:

1. **Logo Size Adjustment**:
   - **Before**: `w-24 h-24` (96px × 96px) - appeared squished due to forced square aspect ratio
   - **After**: `w-[360px]` (360px width, height auto) - properly proportioned at natural aspect ratio
   - **Size Increase**: 3.75x larger than original (360/96 = 3.75)
   - **Aspect Ratio**: Natural image proportions maintained to prevent squishing

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - **No More Squish**: Logo now displays in proper proportions
   - **Better Visibility**: Larger size makes logo more prominent
   - **Consistent Layout**: Maintains center alignment and spacing
   - **Professional Appearance**: Logo now has appropriate presence in hero section

3. **Technical Details**:
   - **CSS Classes**: Changed from `w-24 h-24` to `w-[360px]` (height auto)

- 🔍 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Sidebar scroll flickering on hover
  - **Problem**: When hovering over sidebar, page scroll position jumps/flickers
  - **Root Cause**: Dynamic CSS class changes on hover (`overflow-y-auto max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]`)
  - **Impact**: `sticky top-8` positioning gets disrupted when overflow changes
  - **Expected Behavior**: Sidebar should maintain consistent distance from top when scrolling
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Fixed sidebar scroll flickering issue
  - **Root Cause**: Dynamic CSS class changes on hover (`overflow-y-auto max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]`) were causing sticky positioning to recalculate
  - **Solution**: Removed conditional overflow classes, now always use `overflow-y-auto max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]`
  - **Result**: Sidebar now maintains consistent `sticky top-8` positioning without layout shifts
  - **Behavior**: "On This Page" section now maintains constant distance from viewport top when scrolling
  - **Independent Scrolling**: Sidebar still scrolls independently when hovering, but doesn't affect page scroll position
- 🔍 **NEW ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Sidebar height restriction causing cutoff
  - **Problem**: Sidebar has `max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]` which cuts off content at bottom
  - **Current Behavior**: Sidebar scrolls internally when content exceeds viewport height
  - **Desired Behavior**: Sidebar should match main content height and stay fixed in top right
  - **Effect Wanted**: Proper table of contents that stays visible throughout entire blog reading
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Reading style dropdown labels
  - **Change**: Updated dropdown option labels for better UX
  - **Mapping**: 
    - "beginner" → "Novice"
    - "intermediate" → "Technical" 
    - "advanced" → "Analyst"
  - **Implementation**: Added display name mapping function for both button and dropdown options
  - **Result**: More descriptive and user-friendly reading level labels

## Request tagline nowrap

**Task**: Ensure request page tagline renders on single line on desktop
**Issue**: Tagline "Submit a research request for protocols, projects, or topics you'd like us to cover" was wrapping on desktop
**Solution**: Added responsive whitespace classes: `lg:whitespace-nowrap sm:whitespace-normal`
**Result**: 
- Desktop (≥1024px): Tagline appears on single line
- Mobile: Tagline wraps naturally as before
**Changes**: `src/app/request/page.tsx` - minimal diff to tagline paragraph
**Rollback**: Remove `lg:whitespace-nowrap sm:whitespace-normal` classes from tagline

## Premium dark theme pass

**Task**: Give `/premium` a dark theme with interest (black/dark background using our existing design tokens), plus a tasteful gradient/texture. Keep the page a simple stub otherwise.

**Issue**: Premium page was using light theme colors that didn't match our brand aesthetic
**Solution**: Applied dark theme using existing design tokens with subtle gradient textures
**Result**: 
- Dark background using `--color-horizon-brown-dark` as base
- Subtle diagonal gradient from brown-dark → brown → gray
- Radial gradient overlays with brand colors (green/blue) at low opacity
- Glass-morphism cards with `bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm`
- High contrast white text over dark backgrounds
**Changes**: `src/app/premium/page.tsx` - transformed entire page from light to dark theme
**Rollback**: Restore original light theme classes and remove dark background layers
**Token references used**:
- `--color-horizon-brown-dark` (base background)
- `--color-horizon-brown` (gradient middle)
- `--color-horizon-gray` (gradient end)
- `--color-horizon-green` (accent color)
- `--color-brand-400` (subtle overlay)

**Additional enhancement**: Added right-aligned glass CTA button linking to About section
- Uses custom styling (removed `fancy-btn` class to reduce glow by ~80%)
- Positioned inline with billing cycle tabs using `flex justify-between items-center`
- Includes info icon and "WHAT IS HORIZON?" text
- Smaller size: `px-4 py-2` mobile, `sm:px-6 sm:py-3` desktop
- Reduced icon size from `w-5 h-5` to `w-4 h-4`
- Simplified hover effects with `backdrop-blur-sm` and `hover:bg-white/90`
- **Final positioning**: Same horizontal alignment as MONTHLY/QUARTERLY/YEARLY tabs

## Why page scrolling sensitivity fix

**Task**: Fix scrolling sensitivity on `/why` page - too sensitive, need less sensitive while maintaining snapping behavior
**Issue**: Wheel events triggered section changes on every small scroll, making navigation too jumpy
**Solution**: Implemented scroll threshold system with accumulated delta
**Result**: 
- **Scroll threshold**: Increased from immediate trigger to 120px accumulated scroll
- **Less sensitive**: Requires more intentional scrolling to change sections
- **Maintains snapping**: Each section still locks into center view
- **Smoother experience**: Reduced accidental section changes
- **Timeout reset**: Threshold resets after 300ms of no scrolling
**Changes**: `src/app/why/page.tsx` - added `scrollThreshold` ref and updated wheel handler
**Rollback**: Remove `scrollThreshold` ref and restore original wheel event logic
**Technical details**:
- Added `scrollThreshold.current += e.deltaY` accumulation
- Threshold: `Math.abs(scrollThreshold.current) >= 120`
- Wheel timeout: 300ms for threshold reset
- Scroll timeout: 1000ms for animation completion

## /why page nav + scrolling refactor

**Task**: Fix `/why` page layout, navigation pill, and scrolling behavior
**Issue**: Navigation pill was horizontal at bottom-center, scrolling was janky
**Solution**: 
- **Navigation pill**: Moved to right-hand corner, vertical orientation with up/down arrows
- **Scrolling**: Improved sensitivity and consistency
**Result**: 
- **Navigation pill**: Now vertical on right side with up/down arrows and section indicators
- **Positioning**: `fixed right-6 top-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2 z-50`
- **Styling**: Glass/translucent with `bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20`
- **Arrows**: Up/down navigation with hover effects and disabled states
- **Section indicators**: 7 dots showing current section with green highlight
- **Scrolling**: Consistent 1000ms timeout for all navigation actions
- **Keyboard support**: Arrow keys and Page Up/Down work with smooth scrolling
**Changes**: `src/app/why/page.tsx` - replaced horizontal navigation with vertical pill
**Rollback**: Restore original horizontal navigation pill at bottom-center
**Technical improvements**:
- All scroll timeouts standardized to 1000ms for consistency
- Navigation pill uses tokenized colors (`--color-horizon-green`)
- Proper accessibility with `aria-label` attributes
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Hydration error fix for /why page

**Issue**: React hydration error due to `Math.random()` in floating particles
**Problem**: Server and client generated different random values for particle positioning
**Solution**: Replaced random values with deterministic calculations based on index
**Result**: 
- **Before**: `Math.random() * 100` for left/top positioning
- **After**: `((i * 7) % 100) + (i % 3) * 15` for left, `((i * 11) % 100) + (i % 5) * 12` for top
- **Animation**: `(i * 0.3) % 5` for delay, `4 + (i % 6)` for duration
**Changes**: `src/app/why/page.tsx` - floating particles now use deterministic positioning
**Technical**: Eliminates SSR/client mismatch while maintaining visual variety

## Remove "See More" buttons from /why page

**Task**: Remove all centered scrolling buttons from the /why page
**Issue**: User wanted to remove the "See More" buttons that help with scrolling
**Solution**: Removed all 6 "See More" buttons that were positioned at bottom-center of each section
**Result**: 
- **Removed buttons**: "The Problem", "The Solution", "Why Choose Horizon?", "Trusted by Thousands", "Get Started"
- **Navigation**: Users now rely on the vertical navigation pill on the right side for section navigation
- **Cleaner UI**: Less visual clutter, more focus on content
**Changes**: `src/app/why/page.tsx` - removed all `absolute bottom-8 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2` button containers
**Technical**: Maintains keyboard navigation and vertical pill functionality
- ✅ Added fallback for invalid date values
- ✅ Completed Slop Guard Landing Carousel Task:
  - ✅ Reduced center card hover scale from 1.10 to 1.05 (~50% reduction)

**Ready for Phase 3**: Component consolidation optimizations
**No Blockers**: All Phase 2 tasks completed successfully
**Execution Strategy**: Ready to begin Phase 3 optimizations focusing on merging duplicate components
**Testing Status**: Development server running on localhost:3000, ready for Phase 3 execution
**Next Steps**: 
1. Begin Phase 3: Merge ProductCard and ProtocolCard components
2. Focus on component consolidation opportunities
3. Identify and merge duplicate code patterns
4. Continue systematic LOC reduction approach

## Lessons

- **Code Analysis**: Found significant duplication opportunities (400-500 LOC reduction potential)
- **Planning**: Breaking fixes into small, testable chunks with clear rollback paths
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive tracking documents for accountability
- **Banner System**: All banners must maintain 3:1 horizontal ratio (1500x500) for consistency
- **Layout Grid Issues**: When using CSS Grid, always specify explicit column spans (`col-span-X`) to ensure proper content distribution. Default behavior can cause content to be cramped in unexpected ways.
- **Icon Consolidation**: Analysis paralysis - Icons.tsx already well-organized, inline SVGs are mostly unique use cases. Better to focus on higher-impact optimizations first.
