# Horizon Radar Scratchpad

## EXECUTOR GUIDELINES - CRITICAL

### AI Slop Prevention Rules
**BEFORE starting any phase, the executor MUST:**
1. **Rethink the proposed steps** - Are they well thought out and won't create AI slop?
2. **Question over-engineering** - Is this the simplest approach that achieves the goal?
3. **Avoid analysis paralysis** - If a task seems too complex, simplify it or skip it
4. **Focus on high-impact changes** - Prioritize LOC reduction over perfect abstractions
5. **Test incrementally** - Make small changes and verify they work before proceeding
6. **Question every abstraction** - Do we really need this new component/utility/pattern?

### Git Permission Rules
**CRITICAL: NEVER commit or push changes without explicit permission**
1. **No automatic commits** - All changes must be manually reviewed
2. **Ask for permission** - Request explicit approval before any git operations
3. **Document changes** - Update scratchpad with what was changed, not what will be changed
4. **Wait for confirmation** - Don't proceed to next phase without user approval

## Phase 1: Complete Image Migration to Database (URGENT) 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Root Cause Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Images scattered across localStorage, public folder, and database fields
- **Public Images**: 9 images (1.2MB total) in `/public/images/`
- **Database Fields**: ✅ Ready for image URLs (500 char limit)
- **localStorage**: Using hardcoded paths instead of database URLs
- **Missing**: No centralized image management system

### Implementation Plan ✅ COMPREHENSIVE MIGRATION
**Target**: All images stored in database with proper URL management
**Approach**: Migrate images to Ocean droplet + update all references

#### Step 1: Create Environment Configuration (5 minutes)
- **Action**: Create `.env.local` with Ocean droplet database URL
- **Success Criteria**: `DATABASE_URL` properly configured
- **Files**: `.env.local` (new file)
- **Implementation**:
  ```bash
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://horizon_user:HorizonRadar2024!@159.65.243.245:5432/horizon_radar?sslmode=require
  ```

#### Step 2: Test Database Connection (10 minutes)
- **Action**: Verify Ocean droplet database connectivity
- **Success Criteria**: `npm run db:studio` opens database interface
- **Files**: Database connection test
- **Implementation**: Test database connection and view existing data

#### Step 3: Create Image Upload API Route (20 minutes)
- **Action**: Create `/api/upload-image` endpoint for Ocean droplet storage
- **Success Criteria**: Images can be uploaded to Ocean droplet
- **Files**: `src/app/api/upload-image/route.ts` (new file)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Accept multipart form data
  - Store images in Ocean droplet file system
  - Return public URLs for database storage
  - Handle image optimization and compression

#### Step 4: Migrate Public Images to Database (30 minutes)
- **Action**: Upload all 9 public images to Ocean droplet + update database
- **Success Criteria**: All public images accessible via database URLs
- **Files**: Database seed update, image migration script
- **Implementation**:
  - Upload each public image to Ocean droplet
  - Update database with new URLs
  - Replace hardcoded `/images/` paths with database URLs

#### Step 5: Update Profile Upload System (25 minutes)
- **Action**: Modify profile upload to use Ocean droplet + database
- **Success Criteria**: Profile pictures save to database instead of localStorage
- **Files**: `ProfileUploadModal.tsx`, `useProfilePicture.ts`, profile page
- **Implementation**:
  - Replace base64 storage with file upload to Ocean droplet
  - Save URLs to `userProfiles.avatar` field
  - Update all profile picture display logic

#### Step 6: Update Article Image System (20 minutes)
- **Action**: Modify article creation to use Ocean droplet + database
- **Success Criteria**: Article images save to database instead of localStorage
- **Files**: Admin article creation, article display components
- **Implementation**:
  - Replace hardcoded image paths with database URLs
  - Update `articles.featuredImage` and `articleImages.imageUrl` fields
  - Ensure all article images load from database

#### Step 7: Test Complete Image System (15 minutes)
- **Action**: Verify all images work from database
- **Success Criteria**: No broken images, all uploads work
- **Files**: Complete system testing
- **Implementation**:
  - Test profile picture uploads
  - Test article image uploads
  - Verify all existing images display correctly
  - Test image persistence across sessions

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All 9 public images migrated to Ocean droplet
- ✅ Profile pictures save to database (no more base64)
- ✅ Article images save to database (no more hardcoded paths)
- ✅ No broken images in production
- ✅ Image uploads work in Vercel deployment
- ✅ All images persist across sessions

### Files to Create/Modify
1. `.env.local` - Database connection
2. `src/app/api/upload-image/route.ts` - Image upload API
3. `src/components/ProfileUploadModal.tsx` - Profile upload logic
4. `src/hooks/useProfilePicture.ts` - Database save logic
5. Admin article creation components
6. Database seed updates
7. Image migration script

### Why This Approach is Production-Ready
- ✅ **Centralized storage** - All images in Ocean droplet
- ✅ **Database-driven** - No more hardcoded paths
- ✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new images
- ✅ **Persistent** - Images survive localStorage clearing
- ✅ **Vercel compatible** - No serverless memory issues
- ✅ **Professional** - Proper image management system
