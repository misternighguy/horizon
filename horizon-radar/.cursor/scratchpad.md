# Horizon Radar Admin Panel - Article Creation Feature

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested a comprehensive article creation system within the admin panel that includes:
- A main article creation form at `/admin/create/article`
- A test article form at `/admin/create/test` (limited to one test article)
- Integration with the existing admin panel
- Drag & drop functionality for section reordering
- Visibility toggles for sections using eye icons
- Support for all blog fields (TLDR, abstract, project name, ticker, official links, etc.)
- Flexible sections for team members, tokenomics, sources, and links
- Pre-filled table of contents with editability
- Publish functionality
- Mock data population for the blog section

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Form Complexity**: The article creation form needs to handle multiple section types with different data structures
2. **Drag & Drop**: Implementing reorderable sections requires state management and drag & drop libraries
3. **Visibility Toggles**: Each section needs individual visibility controls
4. **Flexible Arrays**: Team members, tokenomics, sources, and links need dynamic add/remove functionality
5. **Data Validation**: Ensuring all required fields are filled before publishing
6. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrating with existing admin panel and data structures

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Admin Panel Integration
- [ ] Add "Create Article" button to admin panel dashboard
- [ ] Create navigation links to article creation pages
- [ ] Update admin panel content management tab

### Phase 2: Article Creation Form Structure
- [ ] Create `/admin/create/article` page with form layout
- [ ] Create `/admin/create/test` page with similar structure
- [ ] Implement form sections for all required fields
- [ ] Add visibility toggle controls for each section

### Phase 3: Advanced Form Features
- [ ] Implement drag & drop for section reordering
- [ ] Add dynamic add/remove for flexible arrays (team, tokenomics, sources, links)
- [ ] Create custom section addition functionality
- [ ] Implement pre-filled table of contents with editability

### Phase 4: Data Management & Publishing
- [ ] Implement form validation
- [ ] Add publish functionality
- [ ] Create data persistence layer
- [ ] Handle test article uniqueness constraint

### Phase 5: Mock Data Population
- [ ] Research and create 10 realistic project articles
- [ ] Populate blog section with mock data
- [ ] Ensure data follows established format and structure

### Phase 6: Testing & Integration
- [ ] Test all form functionality
- [ ] Verify drag & drop works correctly
- [ ] Test visibility toggles
- [ ] Validate publish workflow
- [ ] Test admin panel integration

## Project Status Board

### Current Status / Progress Tracking
- **Status**: Implementation Phase - Article Management System Complete!
- **Current Task**: Phase 1, 2, 3, and 5 completed - Full article management workflow implemented
- **Next Milestone**: Phase 4 - Data persistence and advanced features

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Added "Create Article" and "View Drafts" buttons to admin panel dashboard
- ✅ Updated admin panel content management tab with article management links
- ✅ Created `/admin/create/article` page with comprehensive form
- ✅ Created `/admin/drafts` page for managing all article drafts
- ✅ Created `/admin/test` page for test articles (admin-only)
- ✅ Implemented beginner/intermediate/advanced reading level switching
- ✅ Fixed synchronization logic: now properly tracks sync state and shows correct buttons
- ✅ Implemented independent visibility toggles per reading level
- ✅ Added flexible arrays for team members, links, sources, categories, and chains
- ✅ Created custom section addition functionality
- ✅ Implemented pre-filled table of contents with editability
- ✅ Implemented full article workflow: Save → Test → Publish
- ✅ Added Save Article (saves to drafts), Test Article (moves to test), and Publish functionality
- ✅ Created comprehensive draft management system
- ✅ Test articles are automatically backed up to drafts
- ✅ Installed required Heroicons package
- ✅ Created comprehensive blog page at `/blog`
- ✅ Populated blog with 10 realistic mock articles covering major crypto projects
- ✅ Removed public navigation links - users find articles through search
- ✅ Implemented search, filtering, and sorting functionality for blog articles

### In Progress
- Phase 4: Data persistence and advanced features (drag & drop, enhanced functionality)

### Blocked/Needs Attention
- None currently

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Ready to begin implementation once plan is approved
- Will need to research drag & drop libraries for React
- May need clarification on specific field requirements for articles

## Important Notes

- **Blog page**: Available at `/blog` but not linked in navigation (users find articles through search)
- **Test page**: Admin-only at `/admin/test` - not publicly accessible
- **Article URLs**: Will follow pattern `/article/[slug]` (e.g., `/article/glow`, `/article/eth`)

## Lessons

- Always read existing files before making changes
- Consider the complexity of form state management for multi-section forms
- Plan for flexible data structures that can accommodate varying numbers of items
