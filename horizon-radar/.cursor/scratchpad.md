# Horizon Radar Scratchpad

## EXECUTOR GUIDELINES - CRITICAL

### AI Slop Prevention Rules
**BEFORE starting any phase, the executor MUST:**
1. **Rethink the proposed steps** - Are they well thought out and won't create AI slop?
2. **Question over-engineering** - Is this the simplest approach that achieves the goal?
3. **Avoid analysis paralysis** - If a task seems too complex, simplify it or skip it
4. **Focus on high-impact changes** - Prioritize LOC reduction over perfect abstractions
5. **Test incrementally** - Make small changes and verify they work before proceeding
6. **Question every abstraction** - Do we really need this new component/utility/pattern?

### Git Permission Rules
**CRITICAL: NEVER commit or push changes without explicit permission**
1. **No automatic commits** - All changes must be manually reviewed
2. **Ask for permission** - Request explicit approval before any git operations
3. **Document changes** - Update scratchpad with what was changed, not what will be changed
4. **Wait for confirmation** - Don't proceed to next phase without user approval

### **PHASE 1: EMERGENCY SIMPLIFICATION (Week 1) - STARTING NOW**

#### **1.1 Database Schema Analysis & Optimization ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- **Current**: 50+ tables, 619 lines
- **Target**: Keep necessary complexity, remove true bloat
- **Actions**:
  - ‚úÖ **THOROUGH ANALYSIS FIRST**: Examine all pages to see what data is actually needed
  - ‚úÖ **Cross-reference**: Articles page, research cards, watchlist, create articles, test articles
  - ‚úÖ **Keep localStorage structure**: It has good setup, mirror it in droplet
  - ‚úÖ **Make schema dynamic**: Room for expansion without breaking changes
  - ‚úÖ **Separate concerns**: Profile/User info, Articles/Content, Website/Content differently

**ANALYSIS FINDINGS - MOST SCHEMA IS NECESSARY:**
- **Articles**: Complex structure needed for reading levels, content sections, images, tokenomics
- **Users**: Profile management, preferences, watchlists, authentication
- **Comments**: Full comment system with replies, moderation, user management
- **Research Cards**: Categorized research display with scoring and metadata
- **Protocols**: Complex protocol data with sections, metrics, and relationships
- **Newsletter**: Subscription management and user tracking
- **Admin**: Full admin panel with user management, content moderation, database operations

**localStorageDB Methods Actually Used (25+ methods):**
- Article CRUD: `getArticles`, `getArticleBySlug`, `createArticle`, `updateArticle`, `deleteArticle`
- User Management: `getUsers`, `getUserByUsername`, `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser`
- Comments: `getComments`, `getCommentsByArticle`, `createComment`, `updateComment`, `deleteComment`
- Research: `getResearchCardsByCategory`, `getProtocolSummaries`
- Newsletter: `createNewsletterSubscription`, `updateNewsletterSubscription`, `getNewsletterSubscriptionByEmail`
- Database: `exportDatabase`, `backupDatabase`, `restoreFromBackup`, `clearDatabase`

**CONCLUSION**: The localStorage structure is well-designed and the database schema is mostly necessary. We need to mirror this structure in the DigitalOcean database, not simplify it.

#### **1.2 Fix DigitalOcean Database Connection üîÑ IN PROGRESS**
- **Current**: Deployment scripts exist but database is empty
- **Target**: Working PostgreSQL with real data from localStorage structure
- **Actions**:
  - SSH into droplet (password: "JesusChrist")
  - Run `./provision.sh` to set up database
  - Create schema that mirrors localStorage structure
  - Add basic seed data (5-10 articles)
  - Test API connections

## Lessons

- **Code Analysis**: Found significant duplication opportunities (400-500 LOC reduction potential)
- **Planning**: Breaking fixes into small, testable chunks with clear rollback paths
- **Vercel Deployment**: SSR compatibility is critical - localStorage and window access must be guarded
- **Build Success**: All critical TypeScript errors and SSR issues resolved - build now passes successfully
- **Database Implementation**: Complex database schemas require careful planning and testing
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js image optimization improves performance but requires proper configuration
